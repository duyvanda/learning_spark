1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,760
Next let's briefly talk about GraphX.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,560
this is one of the other main blocks that sit on top of Spark core -

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,170
so we should talk about it. Now, when we talk about GraphX and graph processing we're not talking about

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,580
line charts and pie charts and things like that,

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,320
we're talking about graphs in the computer science sense.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,430
So things like social networks where you have these nodes that represent people, and they're interconnected

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,400
by their relationships,

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,860
that's the kind of graph that we're talking about here.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,200
Kind of like our social network of superheroes that we had,

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,980
you know, remember we had the example of Marvel superheroes that were connected by what comics they appeared

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,870
together in -

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,870
that's an example of a graph.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,390
Now the thing with GraphX is that it's currently only available in the Scala API, Python support doesn't

14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,640
really seem to be coming anytime soon, if at all. GraphX

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,220
quite honestly it's been kind of languishing for the past few years, it hasn't really caught on as

16
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,720
something that a lot of people are using,

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,360
so it hasn't gotten a lot of attention from the maintainers of the open source version of Apache Spark

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,350
and there are some third party packages out there that people seem to be leaning more toward than using

19
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,210
GraphX itself.

20
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,250
The thing is, it's only really useful for a few specific things

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,400
and this is probably part of why it hasn't really been adopted very much.

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,740
It wouldn't have actually helped us a whole lot with our degrees of separation example, for example.

23
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,230
You would think it would, you know, but it doesn't.

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,840
But it can do things like measure things like connectedness or degree distribution and average path

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,320
length and triangle counts.

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,600
Basically, these high level measures that describe the properties of a graph as a whole

27
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,630
and it can also join graphs together and transform them very quickly,

28
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,660
that's what it's all about, that's why you want to distribute this with Spark,

29
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,190
if you have two large graphs and you need to merge them together, GraphX is a good tool for doing that.

30
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:36,780
Under the hood,

31
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,910
it introduces a couple of new data types called a VertexRDD and EdgeRDD,

32
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,490
but otherwise, GraphX code looks like pretty much any other Spark code,

33
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,500
it's not really that unusual.

34
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,320
So if you do need to work with network analysis code and graphs of information like that, it might be

35
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,760
worth learning Scala and maybe, maybe picking up the Scala version of this course to get a hands on example

36
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,140
of using GraphX,

37
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,200
but as of now, in the world of Python Spark, it's not really something you can do, but you should at least

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,160
know what GraphX is -

39
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,900
because it is a component of spark itself and well, that's what it's all about.

40
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,760
Next let's briefly talk about GraphX,
