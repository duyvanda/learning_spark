1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,160
OK.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,110
Time has passed.

3
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,220
So let's review what happened and take a look at our results from our 1 million ratings movie similarities

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:12,280
run. All right, about 15 minutes later we have some actual results here to look at.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,570
So let's take a look at what we ended up with.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,860
After analyzing 1 million ratings and using that same script, our results were for the top similar movie

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,430
to Star Wars Episode 4 was Star Wars Episode 5.

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:30,220
Not too surprising, but the next sentence is a little bit surprising; some little movie called San Duro

9
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,250
that had a very high similarity score.

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,600
But let's look at what's going on there.

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,610
It's actual strength, the number of people that actually rated that together with Star Wars, is only 60.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,070
So you know, I think it's safe to say that's kind of a spurious result. And now that we're using a million

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:51,190
ratings, we probably need to increase that minimum threshold on the number of creators in order to actually

14
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,730
display our results.

15
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,100
So by doing so, we could probably pretty easily filter out movies like that and instead get Raiders Of

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,230
The Lost Ark as our second result, which I think is interesting because it's actually scoring better

17
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,550
than Return Of The Jedi.

18
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:11,290
So you know I'm no film critic but maybe you too also enjoyed Raiders Of The Lost Ark more than Return

19
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:11,860
Of The Jedi.

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,640
I know I did.

21
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,590
So that's not that crazy.

22
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,290
We then get Run Silent Run Deep from 1958.

23
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,360
Again kind of a spurious result, with only one hundred and forty five co raters, and that doesn't sound

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,790
like, that sounds like a lot of people, but in the context of a million ratings not so much. So moral of the

25
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,380
story is, a lot of times you need to go back and kind of adjust your algorithms and clean your data a

26
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,300
little bit differently when you're running at a larger scale to get the results you want.

27
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,450
So data mining and using big data is not magic.

28
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,770
You do not automatically get better results just because you have more data.

29
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,400
In fact often the opposite is true.

30
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,880
So let that be a lesson to you.

31
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,860
But hey, we actually successfully ran this thing.

32
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,890
So that's a cool thing.

33
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,880
Let's shut down this cluster before we forget.

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:53,760
OK.

35
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,870
So now that I have a result, the most important thing is to remember to terminate that cluster.

36
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,460
So I don't keep getting billed for it.

37
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,320
That would be bad.

38
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:02,700
All right.

39
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:09,430
So let's go to the console dot AWS dot Amazon.com and I'm gonna click on EMR and find my cluster.

40
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:14,980
There it is, with the green circle next to it, meaning that that is currently running racking up a bill

41
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,400
for me.

42
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,570
But let's shut it down.

43
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:22,940
So let's click on that cluster and then click on terminate. Am I sure?

44
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,500
Yes. I'm going to lose everything I'm totally OK with that.

45
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,350
Just stop billing me for it.

46
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:28,710
All right.

47
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,250
You want to make sure that actually terminates, and that the status actually goes from running to terminated

48
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,070
and assuming you do, you will stop getting billed and that's all there is to it.

49
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,620
All right.

50
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:44,920
We have successfully run a one million ratings analysis on a cluster on a classic map produced using

51
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,330
on spark on top of Hadoop and we've shut down the cluster now that we're done with it.

52
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,940
Pretty cool.

53
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,280
And there you have it.

54
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,460
Movie similarities from one million ratings running on a cluster in a cloud on elastic map reduce

55
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,630
using spark.

56
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,280
Pretty awesome! Remember to terminate your cluster when you're done.

57
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,540
I'm going to keep saying that over and over and over again, because you really don't want that bill if

58
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,760
you're running this yourself. Terminate any clusters in the Amazon Web Services console using the EMR

59
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,100
tab.

60
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,500
OK. If you leave those running you're going to get a very big bill and you're not going to be happy.

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,150
But hey we got results.

62
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,470
That's awesome!

63
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,670
You are now officially processing big data in the cloud and that's what this course is all about.

64
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:29,220
So congratulations! Let's talk about troubleshooting jobs next and what you need to do when things go

65
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:29,600
wrong.
