1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,040
Ok real quick let's go through how to get set up on Amazon Web Services and create an account that you

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,980
can use to spin up your own plastic map reduce cluster for running spark jobs on the Cluster.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,480
We'll also talk about how you can connect to that cluster because going forward you're not going to

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,910
be running your spark drive or scripts on your desktop anymore.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,400
You're going to be running them from a master node on an easy to Linux instance in the cloud.

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,900
So you're going to have to be able to connect to that easy to instance from your desktop.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,260
Let's go over how to do that on Windows now all right.

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,370
So to get started with Amazon Web Services first we're gonna walk you through how to create an account

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,130
on NWS if you haven't already.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,000
Just a quick pointer of where to go there and when we're done we're gonna figure out how to actually

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,760
connect to the instances that we might be spinning up on Web services so when we actually create a cluster

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,010
for SPARC we need a way to actually log into the master node on that cluster and actually run our script

13
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:53,250
there.

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,280
So to do so we need to get our credentials for logging into any instances that our SPARC cluster spins

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,100
up and we'll also set up a terminal.

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,490
If you're on Windows called putty and go through how to actually use that to connect to your instances.

17
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,210
So we walk you through that right now okay.

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,320
Let's go through how to set up an Amazon Web Services account if you need one and get started with an

19
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,570
elastic map produce and also figure out how to connect to our instances on a classic map reduce.

20
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,710
So again you know if you don't want to risk spending money you're gonna need some.

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,200
You're gonna need a credit card number to sign up for an account here it's gonna cost some real money

22
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,490
and it can actually add up.

23
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,010
So if you do just want to watch.

24
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,390
That's OK but if you want to follow along feel free just make sure that you're careful to shut down

25
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,350
and terminate any clusters that you spin up in the course of this course or else you're gonna rack up

26
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,910
a pretty significant bill and you get a sense of the current pricing you can click on the pricing tab

27
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:54,230
up here and go to products and services and look at easy to the Elastic Compute Cloud because that's

28
00:01:54,230 --> 00:02:00,150
the primary costs of our clusters that will be spending up is just renting time on these computers.

29
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,460
And if you scroll down you can see what individual types of instances cost.

30
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:11,060
Now by default a EMR cluster for SPARC is going to spin up M3 X large instances and these are for you

31
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,610
15 gigabyte apiece instances.

32
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:20,290
So these are very beefy and twenty six cents per hour it may not sound like much but it can add up.

33
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,580
Okay.

34
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,750
I mean that's actually a very reasonable rate for a computer that that powerful I'll grant them that.

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,290
But if you're running 10 of these things in a cluster all of a sudden that's two dollars and 60 cents

36
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,180
per hour and if you're running 10 of these for 10 hours then you're now up to twenty six dollars.

37
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,510
Right.

38
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:40,760
So you've got to be careful that you shut these things down when you're done because they can add up

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,540
quickly if you were to run that for a whole month and not even realize it and just get the bill at the

40
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:44,770
end.

41
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,640
I don't even want to think about how much money that would be.

42
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:53,090
So do exercise caution if you're going to do this yourself but if you are confident in your ability

43
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:58,910
to shut things down when you're done and you have you know some extra money to spend by all means sign

44
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:04,520
up here and follow along with me otherwise let me incur the expense like I said I ran up about 30 dollars

45
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,930
in the course of developing this course.

46
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,840
So there you have it.

47
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:13,070
He made an account just click on the sign into the console link here up in the corner and I'm already

48
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,810
in there but if I wasn't already logged in you would see a screen that would allow you to either enter

49
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,180
your username and password or create a new one.

50
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,650
And at that point you could say create new account and it would ask you for all of your personal information

51
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,870
and credit card information and it would actually call you as part of a two factor authentication process

52
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,830
to make sure that you are who you are and after you get through all of that stuff which I won't bore

53
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:40,110
you with making you watch you should be eventually at a screen that looks like this which is the AWOL

54
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,820
console.

55
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,350
And if you need to get to it it's always available through this little cube icon here.

56
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,720
OK.

57
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:52,880
Now we're going to be doing a lot of work with EMR the elastic map reduce product from Amazon Web Services

58
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,040
and it's not just mass produced it's actually a managed Hadoop framework so it spins up a Hadoop cluster

59
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,880
for you.

60
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,390
And that actually includes SPARC as well.

61
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,580
So EMR it's not just for map produce anymore you can actually use the yarn component of Hadoop as a

62
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,900
cluster manager that spark runs on top of.

63
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:17,210
And by just kicking off an EMR cluster an Amazon Web Services you can very quickly get a master node

64
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:23,090
and as many client you know slave nodes as you want for the job that you have at hand and maybe one

65
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:23,620
is all you need.

66
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,100
Given that you have four cores and a pretty powerful computer but it gives you everything you need it

67
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,090
deploys all the software you need automatically so all you have to do is log into your master node on

68
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:37,430
the Cluster copy your script there and make sure any data that it needs is accessible to it and run

69
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,730
it.

70
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,740
And that's it.

71
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,910
So it's very easy to use.

72
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,380
But first you need a way to actually connect to those instances.

73
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,780
Once you've spun them up and to do so you're gonna need log in authentication credentials.

74
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,740
So to do that you're going to need to get a private and public key pair that you can use for signing

75
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,830
in to your EMR cluster.

76
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,310
So click on the easy to service here.

77
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:06,830
Easy to is the elastic compute cloud which is the underlying service that EMR uses to actually spin

78
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,740
up the different computers in the cluster.

79
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,360
So click on easy to meanwhile click on key pairs.

80
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:20,320
Over here and from here you want to click Create Cupid keep hair and name it something you'll remember

81
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,420
I already created one called Sparky.

82
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,870
So you might want to call it the same thing.

83
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:32,920
And when you hit create it will download to your Downloads folder a spark keyboard PCM file which contains

84
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,410
your public and private key pair.

85
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:40,000
Make sure you actually download that file and keep it somewhere safe and back it up somewhere because

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
once you've downloaded it here you can never get it again.

87
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:43,680
OK.

88
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,670
You can always create a new one if you need to.

89
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,640
But for security reasons they make it impossible to actually re download your public and private key.

90
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,150
And that's in case somebody breaks into your Ada U.S. console account.

91
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:59,140
They don't want them to be able to gain the credentials to actually get into all of the computers on

92
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,260
your cluster and rack up a big bill for you.

93
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:08,620
So I've already done that and downloaded it into my smart course folder and I have a spark kit OPM file

94
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,970
there.

95
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:15,040
And if you need if you're on Windows you're also going to need some sort of terminal application so

96
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,140
you can log into your master node on the cloud and actually get your scripts there and run them and

97
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:25,270
I recommend a program called putty that you can search for if you need a terminal for window and you

98
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,240
don't have it already.

99
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,740
It will bring you to a Web site that looks like this not very fancy and putting itself isn't very fancy

100
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,620
either but it works and you can either install the full Windows Installer here or you can just install

101
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,610
the pieces you need.

102
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,740
The only parts you actually need are putting it out EMC which is the terminal application itself and

103
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,170
putty Gen Daddy XY which we're going to need to convert our APM file that contains our public private

104
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,620
key pair to a PPA file that putty can use.

105
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,260
So I've already done that and downloaded them into my SPARC course folder hit pause if you need to do

106
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,700
the same.

107
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:08,560
And once you have that you can open up putty agenda EMC and click on load which you need to do is change

108
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:17,080
this dropdown for the file filter to all files and select your spark keyed up PCM file and it will load

109
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,720
that in in order to save it as a p p k file that putty can actually use.

110
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,550
You now need to save it as a private key.

111
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:30,700
I'm going to leave the key if the key passphrase empty because it just makes life a lot more complicated

112
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,390
when you're actually trying to use this this key file.

113
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,450
And as long as you have know good physical security for your desktop I wouldn't worry about it too much

114
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,660
if it does make you more comfortable to have a passphrase.

115
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,390
Put one in but you know it's not as necessary as you might think.

116
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,560
So I'm gonna click on save private key is going to say I don't have a passphrase but yeah that's that's

117
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,760
fine by me and I will save it a spark heat up.

118
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,810
I've already done this before so I already have one.

119
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:59,470
So I'm just gonna overwrite the one that I have and at that point you have a spark keyed up K file that

120
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:04,070
will let you log into any cluster that you spin up using the spark key.

121
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,440
Keep hair later on.

122
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:12,430
Now to actually use that PPA file within putty to open up putty itself and when you actually spin up

123
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,510
your cluster you'll get back a hostname that you can use to actually log into the master note of your

124
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,230
spa cluster.

125
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:23,080
But the first thing you'll want to do is go to the SSA tab here open it up and click on off and here

126
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,400
you'll select your K file.

127
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:34,630
And once you have that you can just enter in the hostname of the master node of your cluster and you

128
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,550
can log in automatically without having to sign in with the username and password.

129
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,360
And that's actually more secure that way.

130
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:48,130
So there you have it you have an EMR elastic map reduce Amazon Web Services account ready to go and

131
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,840
you have a terminal ready and able to connect to that cluster as soon as you spin it up.

132
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,430
So we want to make sure we have all these pieces in place beforehand because again time is money on

133
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,750
that cluster once we spin it up and we want to have everything we need ready to go.

134
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,670
So we are now at that point.

135
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,330
All right.

136
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:08,120
Now you have everything you need to spin up a cluster and connect to it.

137
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:13,180
I'm not going to connect to it just yet though because as soon as I spin up that cluster the clock starts

138
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,140
ticking and my bill is going to start getting run up.

139
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,310
We'll wait until the last second to do that because like I mentioned before this really costs money

140
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,050
and you should be very very careful if you're going to be running these clusters yourself if you forgot

141
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:30,550
to shut them down when you're done if you forget to terminate them you're going to get a very big bill

142
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,990
at the end of the month that bill is going to be a lot bigger than the cost for this course.

143
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,940
So I cannot caution you enough to be careful when you're experimenting with EMR and running SPARC in
